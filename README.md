The Meteora DLMM Position Simulator is very simple to use. Just fill in the
input fields to the left, according to the position you wish to simulate. The
liquidity distribution display allows you to drag the current price to the left

changes. This is a great tool for beginners to see how price will affect the
total value of their liquidity as the price moves up and down.
